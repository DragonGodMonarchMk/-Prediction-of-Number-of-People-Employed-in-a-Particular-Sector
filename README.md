# -Prediction-of-Number-of-People-Employed-in-a-Particular-Sector
Predicting employment trends in various sectors using machine learning regression techniques and data visualization for labor market insights.
# 🏢 Prediction of Number of People Employed in a Particular Sector

This project focuses on using **machine learning regression techniques** to predict the number of people employed in specific employment sectors based on various features. It also explores the **trends in labor market** using visual and statistical analysis.

## 🔍 Project Objective

To build a model that can estimate sector-wise employment using historical or categorical data, and analyze which features contribute most to employment numbers.

## 🧠 Dataset Overview

- **Dataset Source**: Assumed custom dataset (details not specified)
- **Key Features**: 
  - Industry/Sector
  - Region or Location
  - Year or Time Index
  - Education level
  - Gender or Demographic details
  - Employment Numbers (target variable)

## 🔬 Tasks Performed

- Data loading, preprocessing, and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature encoding and transformation
- Building and comparing multiple regression models
- Evaluation of predictions using error metrics
- Insights into sector-specific employment patterns

## 🧪 Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor (if applicable)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## 📈 Visualizations

- Employment trends across sectors
- Sector vs number of people employed bar graphs
- Feature importance plots
- Predicted vs actual employment comparisons
